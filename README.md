# Real-Time Language Translation using NMT: Bridging Language Barriers

This project performs **real-time translation of speech and text** using Neural Machine Translation (NMT). It enables users to communicate across languages using speech recognition, Google Translate, and speech synthesis.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎤 Real-time speech input (microphone)
- 🔁 Translation using `googletrans`
- 🗣️ Speech output with `gTTS` and `pygame`
- 🧠 NMT-based translation powered by TensorFlow
- 🌐 Web interface built using Flask

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install all dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
